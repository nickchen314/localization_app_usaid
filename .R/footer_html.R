Specifically, USAID's self-reported localization shares represent figures from the agency's unpublished localization calculation while the figures on the funding obligations tab represent the shares derived directly from USAID's Localization FY2020-2022 Source Data. Any discrepancies between this dashboard's data and any other USAID data sources are likely due to existing inconsistencies between various U.S. open government datasets.")
